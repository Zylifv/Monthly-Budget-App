# Monthly-Budget-App
A small budget app made to test my scripting and CSS skills

I wanted to make a new project from scratch to keep up with my coding/learning journey so a small budget app seemed ideal.
I would like to add a more dynamic "budget bar", perhaps a semi circle that you see on some budget apps.
This was to test my knowledge and see how i could work without any outside resources.

To see a small working example of this project, see my CodePen for a demonstration by following the link below:
